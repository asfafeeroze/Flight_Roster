Hi team,

I've created this section for us to provide updates to each other. I've added two pages to our project: the Login page and the Creating an Account page. However, I've encountered some issues with the background image of these pages. (I haven't been able to identify the cause, it might be a local problem. I don't know.) If any of you are experiencing the same issue or have any insights, please help me resolve it.

Feel free to use this section for any updates you'd like to share.

Have a great week.
